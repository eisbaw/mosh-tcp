* TCP Transport Support

Mosh now supports TCP transport as an alternative to UDP. This is useful
for environments where UDP is blocked by firewalls or VPNs.

Usage:
  $ mosh --protocol=tcp user@host
  $ mosh --protocol=tcp --tcp-timeout=300 user@host

TCP transport provides reliable, ordered delivery but does not support
client IP address roaming like UDP does.
